What is a Crypto Staking Calculator?
A crypto staking calculator is a tool that helps investors estimate their potential earnings from staking cryptocurrencies. Staking is the process of holding and securing a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet to support the operation of a blockchain network or on-chain application (e.g GMX, AAVE, DYDX & other DeFi apps), in return for rewards in the form of the same token.

The calculator takes into account the amount of cryptocurrency being staked, the duration of the stake, the current market price of the cryptocurrency, and the estimated annual percentage yield (APY) of the staking reward. With this information, the calculator provides an estimate of the user's potential earnings from staking the cryptocurrency.

What is the Staking Calculator Formula?
The formula for the Datawallet crypto staking calculator involves three components

Initial Investment (P): This is the amount of cryptocurrency that the user plans to stake.
Annual Percentage Yield (r): This is the estimated percentage of the initial investment that the user will earn as staking rewards over the course of a year.
Time Horizon (t): This is the length of time in years that the user plans to stake the cryptocurrency.
Using these inputs, the formula for calculating the total earnings from staking the cryptocurrency is A = P * (1 + r/365)^(365t).where A is the total earnings, P is the initial investment, r is the annual percentage yield, and t is the time horizon.
